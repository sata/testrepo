# Experiment with Mage

This is the 'service repo' that is suppose to re-use up to date,
common targets for managing our software.

`mage.go` can be named what ever we want, this is our `Makefile`.

It should be primarly using functions (targets) from the build pkg for
keeping consistency over our services.
